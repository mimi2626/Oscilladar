This is an Oscilladar - Oscillators Radar (...),
An artificial neural network designated to spot configurations in the game of life that are oscillators.
- The different networks' architecture used for this project are .txt files under names: network4/5/6,
- And the lists of configurations for datasets are in the .pkl files: new_ts and new_ts-1 - the oscillators and non-oscillators, respectively.
- The video explaining the project is under this link: https://youtu.be/ICyUfw9uXRM
